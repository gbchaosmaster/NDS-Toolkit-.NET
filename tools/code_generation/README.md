# Code Generation Tools

The tools in this directory are to aid the process of developing for the NDS
Toolkit, by speeding up automatable coding tasks. This README will be updated
as new tools are added.

## page_generator

This tool will generate the code for a new NDS Toolkit page and plug that page
into the main GUI, ready for editing. To use it, you may supply the tool a
command-line argument, like so:

```
./page_generator 'Page Title'
```

If you give no command-line argument, it will ask you for your selection at
runtime.
